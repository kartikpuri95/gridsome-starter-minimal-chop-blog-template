Tired of searching how to start a blog? How to create a blog?. Then after a good fight with great search results, you might end up with WordPress or some other paid platform.

Oops did they mention how cumbersome are they to set up? After lots of search around, you end up setting such blogs and then a Sparta!! Kick to your wallet with a monthly or yearly membership.
Well, that was the case with me and I ended up at GitHub pages. Github provides a very basic and minimal setup to host your blog without ever needing a server but just GitHub is not enough because whenever a new post is added we need to update the structure to make sure they are available in RSS feeds. To solve this problem I came across Jekyll. Jekyll is static website generator which takes text format as.MD file or markdown files and generate fully formatted HTML pages. So to publish a blog post one just need to feed the post to Jekyll and re-run the Jekyll. Also, if you want a complete easy setup you can just host a jelly generated files to GitHub and then just add Post markdown files to host them thatâ€™s it.

Advantages of having such a blog-
<li>They are very simple and very straightforward</li>
<li>No complex or untidy code</li>
<li>No clumsy database- Unlike WordPress or Other CMS Jekyll doesn't have any database. All the pages are static HTML pages</li>
<li>A fast-static website is faster as compared to clumsy heavy sites with loads of bloatware</li>
<li>You are in complete control of your design. No need to spend time and understand the code written by some else.</li>
<li>Jekyll sites are very secure because there are 0 to no loopholes to enter from database or PHP code</li>
<li>Easy to host if you have ever worked with GitHub then its just a cake walk</li>


The most amazing post I found about this transition is written by Barry Clark which very well explained in different steps.
